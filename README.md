This is the repository from which the [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev)- and [webpack](https://webpack.js.org)-generated version of [brycewray.com](https://brycewray.com) **formerly** was built before I switched to an [Eleventy-**only** repo](https://github.com/brycewray/eleventy_solo) which now generates the site. **However**, I left this one in place (mostly **not** updated) for others interested in putting Eleventy and webpack together. While there are many others of its type out there and I would encourage you to use *those*, not *this* one, as an example, it nonetheless might help you.

While this is not a &ldquo;starter kit,&rdquo; you can turn it into the latter by doing the following:

1. Clone it to a local repo.
2. Make appropriate changes to the `_data` directory&rsquo;s files.
3. Delete from `src` the Markdown files and images (well, maybe you should keep one or two of each around at the start, until you see how things work).

<hr />

For those interested in other static site generators, I have also created public [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org)- and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io)-based repos. For more information, see “[Different modes for different code](https://brycewray.com/posts/2020/04/different-modes-different-code).” As for the repo links themselves:

- [Gatsby version](https://github.com/brycewray/gatsby_site_css-grid)
- [Hugo version](https://github.com/brycewray/hugo_site_css-grid)

Please note that I **do not** promise to keep them up to date with the real site, but may do so if appropriate.
