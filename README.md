This is the repository from which the [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev)- and [webpack](https://webpack.js.org)-generated version of [brycewray.com](https://brycewray.com) **formerly** was built before I switched to an [Eleventy-**only** repo](https://github.com/brycewray/eleventy_solo) which now generates the site. **However**, I left this one in place (mostly **not** updated) for others interested in putting Eleventy and webpack together. While there are many others of its type out there and I would encourage you to use *those*, not *this* one, as an example, it nonetheless might help you.
