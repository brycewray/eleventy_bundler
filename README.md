This is a reduced-size, “starter”-like version of the repository from which the [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev)- and [webpack](https://webpack.js.org)-generated version of [brycewray.com](https://brycewray.com) **formerly** was built before [I switched](https://brycewray.com/posts/2020/05/going-solo-eleventy) to an Eleventy-**only** repo. **However**, I left this one in place for others interested in putting Eleventy and webpack together. While there are many others of its type out there and I would encourage you to use *those*, not *this* one, as an example, it nonetheless might help you. On 2020-08-01, I made it smaller (very few posts, and only with generic text but some images to let you see how things work) while also adjusting for the fact that I handle images now primarily through use of [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com).
